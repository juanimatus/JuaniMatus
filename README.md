Hi! My name is Juan Ignacio Matus. In this repository you will find some of my Web Projects,
Job Methodology, and Coding Preferences. 

I am currently studying to become an Analyst Programmer at Universidad Abierta Interamericana.

My projects are based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. (Currently, updating Node.js!)

Welcome!
